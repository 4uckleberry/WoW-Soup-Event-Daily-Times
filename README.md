# WoW-Soup-Event-Daily-Times

Made this to keep track of all the times for the Soup Event in World of Warcraft for the Iskaara Rep.

I'm not a programmer by any means.  I'm sure it could be made better, just wanted to share what I made.  
Maybe someone out there finds it useful.

This will show you all the Soup Event times for today and tomorrow.

99% sure that the time zones all work correctly. 

I made certain not to use any libraries that didn't come with Python.  I'm hoping people use it and wanted to make it as easy as possible.

Step 1 - Install Python.  Python already installed?  Skip step 1.

Step 2 - Launch soupdailytimes.pyw

Step 3 - Select time zone, smack that refresh, and farm that REP!

Yes Chef!!!
